### 2:46 Python is Slipping in Popularity

The world’s most popular programming language is losing market share to more specialized languages such as R and Perl, [Tiobe says in their latest poll](https://adafruitdaily.us10.list-manage.com/track/click?u=86903b65c84293425f40fa9a5&id=14d15f9ce5&e=e5fefcd6af). Python still holds the top ranking of programming language popularity, leading by more than 10 percentage points over second-place C. But Python’s lead actually has declined over the past six months, from a high market share of 26.98% last July to 21.81% – [InfoWorld](https://adafruitdaily.us10.list-manage.com/track/click?u=86903b65c84293425f40fa9a5&id=627b1404f1&e=e5fefcd6af).

## 14:20 Hug reports

14:53 @danh (hosting)

* @daniel-alsen for finding and diagnosing a severe slowdown in 10.1.0-rc.0 and later.  
* @arifpedia for greatly expanding the Indonesian translation

15:46 @foamyguy

* DanCogliano for sharing some neat Fruit Jam OS screensavers  
* @relic-se for Fruit Jam Library that allows easy installation of those screensavers and more. And another to relic-se for submitting improvements to BlinkaDisplayioPyGameDisplay library

16:35 @Liz (notes only)

* @Tim for helping out with a CI issue with the CircuitPython bundle repo

16:45 @tannewt

* Daniel and Dan for finding the port\_yield issue in Espressif. This bug is a \+1 for hardware-in-the-loop testing.

17:20 @tekktrik (not present)

* @jake1164 for their patience and work on updating adafruit/build-mpy to use pre-compiled versions of mpy-cross  
* @tannewt for doing a lot of legwork with Zephyr \- I found getting the native\_sim port compiled relatively painless (even in Docker)  
* @tannewt again for prototyping [the infrastructure for running Zephyr in GitHub Actions](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/blob/8d17d0cff4ebcfb3192bb952fe0aeb9b32dd447e/.github/workflows/run-tests.yml#L70C1-L99C42) so I can ditch Docker\!  
* Group hug\!

## 17:55 Status Updates

18:30 @danh (hosting)

* I released and then retracted CircuitPython 10.1.0 after a show-stopper performance problem was found. I will release 10.1.1 later today.  
* Submitted a PR to have `os.getenv()` always return strings from `settings.toml`, and added `supervisor.get_setting()` to retrieve typed values: strings, ints, and (this is new) bools. We could use bools for some proposed enabling/disabling flags.  
* Updating to GCC 15, should be done soon. Noticeable spacing saving with `-Os`.

21:34 @foamyguy

* Finished Tiny Wiki port for CircuitPython/Fruit Jam guide  
* Creating new play store listing for Bluefruit Connect app  
* Looking into [Moonshine voice](https://github.com/moonshine-ai/moonshine) and start to build a NeoPixel voice control system for RPi

23:10 @tannewt

* Working on Zephyr BLE PR polish. I wasn’t happy with how codex hooked into the serial outputs of the emulators.  
* Also poking displays on the side.  
* GPIO input is blocked by BLE PR.

24:55 @tekktrik (not present)

* Updating circfirm to better upload tests to CodeCov, and also more intelligently pick with CIs to run based on changes  
* Also updated circfirm to allow use of command line text editors for configuration settings  
* Reviewed and merged a PR in adafruit/build-mpy, a way to package user projects by compiling to .mpy and creating ZIP files for distribution  
* Started looking at the Zephyr work @tannewt has been working on \- I’ll be starting some prototype CI work to measure the effects of importing libraries over the next few weeks

## 26:20 In The Weeds

@tekktrik (not present)

* How would folks want/expect the import memory check to work?  I have an idea of what I think is best but wanted to check:  
  * It would run similar to pytest, in that it would run specific test code files automatically and simply provide change in memory after importing the library within GitHub Actions in case it was helpful (e.g., when reviewing a PR that refactors a library).  
    * This means it would only run for libraries where memory is a concern (e.g., large libraries, libraries designed for memory-constrained devices)  
  * It could be nice to have a point at which it comments on PRs if the memory changes by X% in a PR, similar to [the existing CI failure action used](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython-action-library-ci-failed)  
    * I don’t know what X is, or if it would just clutter PRs
