## 2:32 Python: What’s Coming in 2026

If 2025 was “the year of type checking and language server protocols” for Python, will 2026 be the year of the type server protocol? “Transformative” developments like free threading are said to be coming to Python in 2026, along with performance-improving “lazy” imports for Python modules. We’ll (hopefully) also be seeing improved Python agent frameworks – [The New Stack](https://thenewstack.io/python-whats-coming-in-2026/). Via the [Adafruit Blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2026/01/12/python-whats-coming-in-2026/).

## 3:29 \#CircuitPython2026 Responses Rolling In

Responses are coming in for the \#CircuitPython2026 data call. Developers would like to hear from you how to improve CircuitPython in 2026\. You have two days left to respond – [Adafruit Blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2026/01/02/circuitpython2026-kickoff/).

* What would you like CircuitPython to do that it can’t?  
* What chipset would you like to run it on?  
* What tools are missing or need improving?  
* What documentation is missing or needs work?  
* How would you like to program and debug CircuitPython?  
* You can even post suggestions on improving this newsletter\!

Please post about \#CircuitPython2026 to some public place on the internet by Wednesday January 21st, 2026 and then let the team know\! When you post, please add \#CircuitPython2026 and email circuitpython2026@adafruit.com with a link. Ideas will be posted on the Adafruit Blog and collated for review.

## 5:02 Fake Raspberry Pi Picos Show Up on AliExpress

AliExpress sellers are now offering their own versions of the Raspberry Pi Pico that can be significantly cheaper than the genuine article. Per Hackaday, they sell for just $2.25. On the fakes, there is no Pi logo and decapping the processor reveals an early stepping of the RP2040 chip prone to USB issues. They are not worth dealing with – [Hackaday](https://hackaday.com/2026/01/15/looking-at-a-real-fake-raspberry-pi-rp2040-board/).
