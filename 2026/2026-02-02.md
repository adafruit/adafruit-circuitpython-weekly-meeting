### PyCharm IDE for Python Development Just Got a Big Update

JetBrains dropped a major update for its Python IDE, PyCharm 2025.3.2. PyCharm and Google Colab are normally treated like separate tools, with the former PyCharm for that serious, heavy-duty local IDE power, and Colab for easy, GPU-accelerated cloud access. This update merges them \- [Yahoo Tech](https://tech.yahoo.com/computing/articles/pycharm-ide-python-development-just-182149426.html) and [JetBrains Blog](https://blog.jetbrains.com/pycharm/2026/01/google-colab-support-is-now-available-in-pycharm-2025-3-2/?utm_source=syndication).

- @2bndy5 for PRs bringing pre-commit to the CircuitPython build tools repository  
- Group hug\!

## Status Updates

@tannewt (host)

* Draft PR for native sim tests is failing CI but Dan approved. (So it is close.)  
* Yoto PR is green on CI and waiting review.  
* Need to write out guide page for Yoto reverse engineering.  
* Main quest is using native sim to test BLE implementation.  
* Side quests for agents:  
  * Getting networking going with native sim for web workflow and socket tests. (Not the ethernet or wifi connection process though.)  
  * Getting USB over IP working for USB testing.  
  * Getting playback from a perfetto trace working for testing stuff that reads input signals: digitalio, pulseio, frequencyio, countio.

@danh

* Fixed build errors in AirLift WiFi PR. I posted some sample code for human testers. Looking for testers\!  
* Looking at some of the existing 10.0.x and 10.1.0 issues to see what to work on before a release.  
* Also will look at MicroPython merges, P4 WiFi.

@foamyguy

* Set up, document, and experiment with Open Claw (Clawdbot/Moltbot) on RPi5.   
* Tried out MicroPython OS on desktop.

@tekktrik (not present)

- PR reviews, particularly in the build tools  
- Picking up some quick fixes here and there  
- Reopening some old ideas for CI/CD improvements, particularly using Wokwi to analyze the amount of memory used by libraries due to importing them \- more to share after some prototyping  
- Hoping to continue working on my CircuitPython CoAP library as time allows

## In The Weeds

## Wrap-Up

* Next week is on Monday. Two week’s is on Tuesday. (President’s Day in the US)
