## 10:46 Hug reports

10:59 @Liz (hosting)

* @Scott for adding support for the Yoto players to the core  
* Group hug

11:09 @danh

* @tannewt for working on built-in support for pin expanders for GPIO. This has a number of uses.

11:46 @foamyguy

* IO Devs: Tyeth, Justin, Loren for answers and ideas about a question I had about random choice functionality for AIO

12:07 @tannewt

* Everyone who wrote up a \#CircuitPython2026. I’m looking forward to getting a ton done this year.  
* Liz for collaborating on the Yoto hacking and writing it all up in the future.

## 12:41 Status Updates

13:03 @Liz (hosting)

* I’m working on documenting a bass synth stomp box project. It's a MIDI output keyboard, running CircuitPython, in a foot pedal form factor so that you can hit different notes while you’re playing another instrument. This type of project is pretty popular and often uses the very expensive and hard to source organ foot pedals.   
* After that I’ll be writing up Scott and my work on the Yoto players in a guide from the perspective of how you can keep IoT devices going

14:11 @danh

* All functionality in Wifi AirLift is implemented. I am having trouble with the AirLift stopping to respond after a lot of HTTP server polling. This may be a NINA-FW problem. I will make a draft PR for people to test.  
* After that, will work on MicroPython merge, bug fixing for a 10.1.0 release, and maybe ESP32-P4 wifi support.

16:02 @foamyguy

* MagTag Haiku viewer guide  
* Library PR reviews, Wiznet5k testing  
* Working on setting up Clawdbot on a pi5

17:00 @tannewt

* PR is out in draft for native IOExpander support and Yoto Mini and Yoto Player V3 board defs.  
* Circling back to Zephyr. Very excited to setup Zephyr’s native simulator and BabbleSim for testing locally.
