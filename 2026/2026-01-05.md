## 3:10 Community News

Newsletter resumes next week.

### 3:32 \#CircuitPython2026

Happy New Year everyone\! CircuitPython turns 9 years old next week ([first beta post](https://blog.adafruit.com/2017/01/09/welcome-to-the-adafruit-circuitpython-beta/)) and once again we’re thinking about the next year of CircuitPython’s growth. We’d like to hear from you how we can improve CircuitPython this year.

* What would you like CircuitPython to do that it can’t?  
* What chipset would you like to run it on?  
* What tools are missing or need improving?  
* What documentation is missing or needs work?  
* How would you like to program and debug CircuitPython?

Just like past years ([2019](https://blog.adafruit.com/2019/01/28/circuitpython-in-2019/), [2020](https://blog.adafruit.com/2020/02/03/circuitpython2020-recap/), [2021](https://blog.adafruit.com/2021/02/16/circuitpython2021-round-up/), [2022](https://blog.adafruit.com/2022/02/01/thank-you-for-circuitpython2022/), [2023](https://blog.adafruit.com/2023/01/23/circuitpython2023-wrap-up/), [2024](https://blog.adafruit.com/2024/01/01/circuitpython-in-2024-circuitpython2024-python-circuitpython/) and [2025](https://blog.adafruit.com/2025/01/15/thank-you-for-circuitpython2025/)), we’d like folks in the CircuitPython community to share their thoughts about CircuitPython’s future. So, please post about \#CircuitPython2026 to some public place on the internet by Wednesday January 21st, 2026 and then let us know\! When you post, please add **\#CircuitPython2026** and email **circuitpython2026@adafruit.com** with a link.

## 12:50 Hug reports

13:20 @tannewt (host)

* Rybec for the first CircuitPython2026 post.   
* Goodroot for the help with hyprwhspr.

13:58 @danh

* Prof John @gallaugher for fantastic introductory CircuitPython material. See [https://gallaugher.com](https://gallaugher.com), especially the CIrcuitPython School YouTube channel and the written material in the course Google Drive for course UNAS/BZAN2175-01.  
* @bablokb for finding a significant performance degradation when SD cards are used in CircuitPython 10\.  
* @tannewt for a good discussion last Friday.

15:52 @foamyguy

* Group hug  
* @RetiredWizard and @Relic-Se for submitting new features and improvements to Fruit Jam OS  
* @d-c-d for submitting FruitJam library issues

16:26 @RetiredWizard (Text Only)

* Group Hug \- Thanks to the Adafruit folks and community contributors for making such a fun and welcoming project\!  
* @Anne for her Fruit Jam port of a Pac-Man clone she built based on the scarolan/pac-wio CircuitPython project  
* @relic-se for providing lots of suggestions and code updates to the Pac-Jam program

16:52 @relic-se (Text only)

* @RetiredWizard and @FoamyGuy for help on review of FJOS Screensavers application updates  
* @RetiredWizard for thorough review of Pac-Jam updates  
* @samblenny fixing harmonic distortion issues on TLV320

## 17:49 Status Updates

18:12 @tannewt (host)

* Out until last Friday. Caught up on emails.  
* Launched \#CircuitPython2026: [https://blog.adafruit.com/2026/01/02/circuitpython2026-kickoff/](https://blog.adafruit.com/2026/01/02/circuitpython2026-kickoff/) Wrap up will be on 1/21 after the 1/20 meeting.  
* Working on I2S support in Zephyr port.  
* Next up is BLE in Zephyr port.  
* Will be deep diving on Friday\!

19:41 @danh

* Good progress debugging native AirLift client. I talked last week with Scott about WiFi workflow using it, and got over some stumbling blocks about storage allocation.  
* Upcoming tasks will be getting WiFi working on the ESP32-P4 EV board, and starting up on CircuitMatter again.

21:31 @foamyguy

* Testing FJOS PRs  
* Playing with USB MIDI and Synthio a lot. Found an issue with receiving multiple messages at once getting backed up, noticed mostly with CC and PitchBend messages, working on a fix for it.  
* Also found cool CPython library [pyo](https://github.com/belangeo/pyo) for audio synthesis and manipulation.

23:30 @RetiredWizard (Text only)

* I’ll be offline most of this week, wandering the CES show floors

## 23:48 In The Weeds

23:50 @relic-se  
Thoughts on FJOS launcher config file (launcher.conf.json) save location: `CIRCUITPY`, \`CPSAVES\`, or sd card. (relevant PR: [https://github.com/adafruit/Fruit-Jam-OS/pull/89](https://github.com/adafruit/Fruit-Jam-OS/pull/89))  
	Ideas from discussion:

* Enforce settings not having different values in different files. Raise an error if multiple values found.  
* Different filenames for the files in different location.

## 34:35 Wrap-Up
