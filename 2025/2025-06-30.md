## 11:54 Hug reports

@Liz (hosting)

* Group hug

12:17 @danh

*  @HaThach for a quick review of a TinyUF2 infrastructure change PR.

12:38 @foamyguy

* @danh for reviewing many PRs for updated OnDiskBitmap API usage \+ Anne for review of same in learn repo

13:00 @mark\[gamblor21\] (lurking)

* Group hug\! Life has gotten busy for the moment but still around.

## 13:09 Status Updates

@Liz (hosting)

* I’ve been working on a few product guides. I updated the tri-color 2.9” eInk guide pages for the new revisions in the shop. I also wrote the guide for the TPS61169 constant current LED driver, which is currently in moderation. Next I’ll start working on the guide and CircuitPython driver for the AS5600 breakout.  
* For projects, I’m working on some code for a Raspberry Pi camera with a thermal camera overlay. This uses the MLX90640 breakout and will likely be published next week.

14:23 @danh

* Working on changeover to larger partition on ESP32-S3 boards. Reworked “Factory Reset” guide pages, but still need to link to updated bootloaders. [https://adafruit-circuit-python.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html?prefix=bootloaders/esp32/](https://adafruit-circuit-python.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html?prefix=bootloaders/esp32/) has been reorganized.  
* Will continue with 10.0.0 issues this week.

16:28 @foamyguy

* Updated all libraries and learn code that were using OnDiskBitmap API from pre 7.x  
* Published 1st version of adafruit\_color\_terminal repo. It holds an extension for terminalio.Terminal that supports ANSI color escapes for subsets of the text  
* Worked on IRC client app, refactored to use dang and handle keyboard input  
* Fix Blinka Displayio py 3.9 support issue caused by typing syntax  
* Looking into support for custom fonts with terminalio.Terminal  
* Submitted issue in the core for MemoryError with strange behavior 

## 20:25 In The Weeds

@Liz 

* Summer schedule \- we will be meeting every 2 weeks in July and August. The meeting calendar has been updated to reflect this. We will start back to our usual weekly meeting in September.
