## 01:47 Community News (from 11/24 newsletter)
### 02:04 Python Remains the #1 Language While C# Grows
The November 2025 TIOBE Index brings another twist below Python’s familiar lead. C solidifies its position as runner-up. C++ and Java lose some ground as C# moves sharply upward, narrowing the gap with Java to less than a percentage point. At the bottom of the leaderboard, long-established languages once again define the shape of the top 10, with Perl reappearing and Go dropping out - TechRepublic.
### 02:42 Electronic Drum Business Cards Built on RP2040 and CircuitPython
Embedded systems engineer Sergey Antonovich has reinvented the age-old business card by turning it into a playable electronic drum kit. Moving from a complex Linux version 1, version 2 was build ready within hours. “I started from a CircuitPython build for a 16MB RP2040 board, prepared a tiny drum sample set, and wrote a short script that scans pads and plays stereo WAVs via audiomixer and audiopwmio.” - Raspberry Pi News.
### 03:22 Project of the Week: A Raspberry Pi Pico W Binary Clock and Weather Monitor
Building a binary clock and weather monitor using the Raspberry Pi Pico W. It displays the time in binary using LEDs and also pulls the current weather data from the internet — all powered by a tiny microcontroller - Instructables, GitHub and YouTube. Via Hackaday.

## 11:20 Hug reports
11:38 @Liz (hosting)
* Group hug

11:45 @danh
* Group hug

11:54 @foamyguy
* @relic-se on GitHub for making and sharing a Fruit Jam OS app store utility
* @RetiredWizard for working on USB trackpad mouse support
* Group hug

12:25 @tannewt
* Everyone who covered meetings for me as I was out. In the office starting today. (Only the morning)
* Renze on Discord for the tip about switching the USB PHY on ESP32-P4 dynamically.

## 13:01 Status Updates
13:24 @Liz (hosting)
* I was out last week for the Thanksgiving holiday, but I use CircuitPython and CPython in personal projects. I wrote a CircuitPython script for a Raspberry Pi that I have running behind my TV to use a STEMMA OLED and an EMC2101 fan controller. The OLED displays the IP address and system status messages. The fan controller uses the CPU temp to adjust the case fan speed. In desktop Python land, I wrote a script that assists with backing up DVDs and Blu-Ray discs. This has been a long-term goal of mine and the script makes it a lot easier by taking care of the logging and grabbing the metadata for the movies and TV shows.
* This week I’ll be starting out by documenting the new ENS161 sensor, which will need an update to the CircuitPython driver, and then I’ll be starting a Hanukkah project that involves a stepper motor, planetary gear and dreidels.

14:37 @danh
* Working on a C implementation of wifi/socketpool/ssl that will support AirLift NINA-FW co-processors. This will narrow the gap between wifi use on Espressif and Pico W boards and boards with AirLift ESP32 or ESP32-C6 co-processors, like PyPortal and Fruit Jam.

16:18 @foamyguy
* Code and guide for https://github.com/adafruit/pi_video_looper2/ an updated version of old project that turns a Raspberry Pi into a dedicated video looper. Now supports Pi 4 & 5 with latest full RasPi OS
* Successfully implemented 4 color FS dither dynamically in python for greyscale photos on MagTag. It’s quite slow, might be cool to have this functionality in bitmaptools. I peeked a little and found the existing dither code is hard-coded for 1-bit using booleans, would need refactored. Unsure if I will attempt.
* Next project: Literary quotes clock on MagTag

18:32 @tannewt
* Out last week because we all got sick over a week ago.
* Back in the office today. (Rynn’s first day of daycare.)
* Started working on Zephyr I2C support.
* Out 12/24 - 1/1.

## 20:08 In The Weeds
* 20:23 Foamyguy - Fruit Jam OS app store, is there any objection to adding this utility which is able to download new applications from 3rd parties GitHub? Would it need some kind of “3rd party content” warning if included? 

## 24:28 Wrap-Up
Next meeting: Monday 12/8
