# CircuitPython Weekly Meeting for June 2, 2025

*Welcome to the CircuitPython Weekly meeting notes\! Feel free to add your Hug Reports and Status Updates before the meeting, alphabetically by your username. During the meeting, we go through them in order. If you can’t make the meeting and would still like to participate, add your notes with a “(missing meeting)” after your username and we’ll read them off for you.* 

*Add any longer-form discussion topics or general questions you have to the “In the weeds” section.* 

*We now convert this document to Markdown on export, instead of including explicit raw Markdown formatting. When you type, just format your contributions with regular Google Docs formatting. If you type using Markdown formatting characters, your input will be converted on the fly to formatted text. You can also right-click and “Paste as Markdown” any text that is using raw Markdown.*

## 10:27 Hug reports

10:42 @Liz (hosting)

* @foamyguy for working on the OPT4048 library and guide  
* Group hug\!

10:59 @danh

* @Timeline8 for fixes  
* @tekktrik for recent GitHub actions and library work  
* @Sola85 for diagnosing an old problem and finding some new ones

11:35 @david.glaude (not present)

* Group Hug\!

11:40 @foamyguy

* @Tekktrik for reviewing some library PRs & Looking into some other library / docs issues  
* @danh for looking into an issue with the report files uploaded to S3

## 12:24 Status Updates

12:42 @Liz (hosting)

* Last week I worked on a CircuitPython library for the SEN6x sensors. This library is used in the Learn Guide for the new SEN6x STEMMA QT adapter breakout which will likely be live later this week.  
* This week I wrote some CircuitPython code for an LED matrix clock. It uses two of the STEMMA QT IS31FL3741 breakouts for the clock display with an ESP32-S3 QT Py and Audio BFF for some audio alarm functionality. I’ll also be working on documenting the INA237 breakout.

13:33 @danh

* Fixed mpy-cross builds to be statically linked again (regression during a previous merge).  
* Switched from gcc13 to gcc14 on circuitpython `main` branch.  
* Did reviews.  
* Working on MicroPython v1.24.1 merge. Going smoothly so far. Will do v1.25 after that.

15:01 @david.glaude (not present)

* Progress on displaying EVVC (Solar panel and EV car charging) on various hardware, while trying to keep a single code base:  
* Trying to dynamically adapt to various screen sizes from different hardware.  
  * Will need to change font size depending on screen size, or display less information on smaller screens.  
* Creating a function (in a separate python file) to isolate the network initialisation. It does detect the board or using the right calls for a AirLift or WizNet Featherwing (based on an extra variable in settings.toml). The function returns socket\_pool and ssl\_context for later use with minimqtt.  
* Creating a Text only version, using print rather than displayio, to be able to test the network code on picoW or other board without screen attached.  
* Currently working combo:  
  * PyPortal  
  * Memento  
  * T-Watch (and other Lilygo ESP+Screen board)  
  * Feather RP2040 \+ FeatherWing AirLift \=\> Text only output  
  * Feather RP2350 \+ FeatherWing WizNet \=\> HSTX/DVI output

16:00 @foamyguy

* Finished OPT4048 driver and guide  
* Updating 8.x displayio API usage in many libraries, almost through all of them found from a search in github  
* Added AnyDisplay type annotation to circuitpyhon\_typing  
* Blinka Displayio \- Removed 8.x API compatibility & fixed circular import issue  
* Wrote code for Feather S2 deep sleep and post data to AIO example and troubshooting an issue with corrupted flash

## 18:26 In The Weeds

@david.glaude (not present)

* Is there an easy way to autodetect what network stack is possibly available on a board? \=\> Are the following assumptions right? How would you suggest doing that?  
  * Assumption 1: If the module “wifi” is present, you are on an ESP or PicoW/Pico2W and you should use that.  
    * *Yes, though “should” is relative… you may have more than one network interface (@anecdata \- text only)*  
  * Assumption 2: If this is a board with built-in AirLift (PyPortal, Metro X+AirLift, …) then there are pins with a specific name that you can identify the availability of an AirLift. \=\> What pin is unique and common to board with AirLift?  
    * *ESP\_CS is usually the pin name (@danh)*  
  * Assumption 3: It is hard to tell if a Feather has an AirLift or WizNet FeatherWing attach, it is easier to have a env variable for that.  
    * *You could define your own env variable for that purpose, because there is no strong CircuitPython need to have such a variable pre-defined (@danh)*  
    * *Or you could completely define the “radio” in an imported python file and use that radio base for wifi, airlift, or ethernet (@anecdata \- text only)*  
* Do you know if it is possible (or plan) to build an AirLift for the FruitJam?  
  * There are exposed additional pins on the FruitJam, but I don’t know if an (additional) SPI bus is possible on those while using every other feature from the board.  
  * If possible, then can the “Adafruit AirLift Shield \- ESP32 WiFi Co-Processor” [https://www.adafruit.com/product/4285](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4285) provide the same feature for the “Franken’s Fruit Jam”?   
  * *Product version of Fruit Jam will probably have an ESP32-C6 (@danh)*
