# CircuitPython Weekly Meeting for May 12, 2025

*Welcome to the CircuitPython Weekly meeting notes! Feel free to add your Hug Reports and Status Updates before the meeting, alphabetically by your username. During the meeting, we go through them in order. If you can’t make the meeting and would still like to participate, add your notes with a “(missing meeting)” after your username and we’ll read them off for you.* 

*Add any longer-form discussion topics or general questions you have to the “In the weeds” section.* 

*We now convert this document to Markdown on export, instead of including explicit raw Markdown formatting. When you type, just format your contributions with regular Google Docs formatting. If you type using Markdown formatting characters, your input will be converted on the fly to formatted text. You can also right-click and “Paste as Markdown” any text that is using raw Markdown.*

*Thanks! We hope to see you in the meeting!*

***Tim** is hosting.*

### 04:06 A New Raspberry Pi OS Release

Raspberry Pi just published a new version of Raspberry Pi OS — their recommended (and free) operating system for all Raspberry Pi computers — and it’s now available for download. This is likely the final release of Raspberry Pi OS which is based on Debian *bookworm*, before Debian *trixie* is released this summer \- [Raspberry Pi News](https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/a-new-raspberry-pi-os-release/). Via [X](https://x.com/Raspberry_Pi/status/1920134984901300574).

**Some New Features**

* Auto login options  
* New Printers application  
* Better touchscreen handling  
* Version 0.8.1 of the labwc Wayland window manager  
* Squeekboard virtual keyboard allows multiple displays

### 05:19 CircuitPython 10.0.0-alpha.4 Released

CircuitPython 10.0.0-alpha.4 is an alpha release for 10.0.0. Further features, changes, and bug fixes will be added before the final release of 10.0.0. This release is nearly the same as 10.0.0-alpha.3 but has a bug fix that breaks finalisers and results in "in use" errors. (Finalisers will usually release the resources.) It also fixes crashes on ESP32-CX RISC-V boards \- [GitHub](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/releases/tag/10.0.0-alpha.4).

**Highlights of this release**

* A number of new audio effects.  
* Improved garbage collection times  
* ESP-IDF update to 5.4.1  
* Improved audio playback on RP2

## 20:49 Hug reports

21:16 @foamyguy

* @MarkGamblor and eightycc both for reviewing core PRs  
* @tannewt for help & direction on Terminal and TPM core PRs  
* Group hug

21:50 @anecdata (text only)

* @eightycc for researching deep and wide, and ultimately fixing an intermittent safe mode on espressif affecting HTTP Server (probably among other things)

22:19 @eightycc (text only, audio out of order)

* @foamyguy for swapping meeting weeks. I need a bit more practice to get OBS just right.  
* @anecdata for giving the intermittent ESP32-Sx crash fix a thorough workout.  
* @BlitzCityDIY for all the helpful OBS hints.  
* @tannewt for all the help with the Python interpreter crash and for devising a long-term solution to register-aware gc for the entire collection of target cores.

23:04 @tannewt (notes only)

* @eightycc for all of the fixes and reviews.  
* @foamyguy and @JP for helping with USB testing

## 23:22 Status Updates

23:52 @foamyguy

* Fix pdf docs build issue  
* Core PR updating Terminal to show 4 spaces in place of “\\t”  
* Core PR further integrating TilePaletteMapper and TileGrid together and making palette mapping updates more efficient by not causing the full TileGrid to get refreshed  
* Fruit Jam OS Editor: change the visible cursor to use TilePaletteMapper. Add support for showing and typing tab characters.

25:31 @eightycc (text only, audio out of order)

* Resolved a hard to find issue that was intermittently crashing ESP-32Sx boards running HTTP/HTTPS servers.  
* Several reviews, several issues fixed.  
* Continue working on 10.0.0 milestone issues.

25:57 @tannewt (notes only)

* 8 weeks of paternity leave starting Thursday so I won’t be doing notes for meetings.  
* Have been doing fixes while the baby naps. Also alpha.4 release.  
* Enabled CloudFront logging so we can get better download counts.  
* Released alpha.4. Alpha.5 should be soon to pick up more fixes.
