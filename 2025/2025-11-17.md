## 2:12 Community News

This is news from the past two weeks of the Python on Microcontrollers newsletter.

### 2:41 CircuitPython 10.1.0 Beta 1 Released

CircuitPython 10.1.0-beta.1 is the latest beta release for 10.1.0. It has known bugs that will be fixed before the final release of 10.1.0 – [Adafruit Blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2025/11/06/circuitpython-10-1-0-beta-1-released/) and release notes – [GitHub](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/releases/tag/10.1.0-beta.1).  
Highlights of this release

* Add mipidsi module to support MIPI DSI displays. Currently enabled for ESP32-P4.  
* Fix problems with presenting user-mounted SD cards over USB.

### 3:38 New Version of VSCode Extension “CircuitPython Sync” Adds Serial Port Support

Version 2 of the Visual Studio Code extension “CircuitPython Sync” adds support for devices that don’t present a CIRCUITPY drive, such as the Adafruit ESP32 Feather V2 and other brands. Version 2 offers almost all the features of Version 1 for serial port boards, such as file and library upload, a full featured board explorer and extensive built-in help. The extension continues to be fully open-source – [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=padgettholdings.circuitpythonsync).

### 4:21 IKEA Launches a New Smart Home Range With 21 Matter-Compatible Products

IKEA is launching 21 new smart home products focusing on lighting, sensors, and control — all built to work with Matter, the universal smart home standard. The launch marks a significant step in making smart home technology easier to use, more affordable, and better adapted to real-life needs in the home. This includes lighting, sensors and control – [Ikea](https://www.ikea.com/global/en/newsroom/retail/the-new-smart-home-from-ikea-matter-compatible-251106/).

This is of interest to CircuitPython because of our work on the CircuitMatter implementation of Matter.

### 5:34 Raspberry Pi is the New Home for Blockly

The Raspberry Pi Foundation is the new home for Blockly, the leading open source library for visual programming. Formerly at Google, Blockly can be found in Scratch, MakeCode, Adafruit IO and some versions of Python – [Raspberry Pi Foundation Blog](https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/new-home-for-blockly/).

## 16:20 Hug reports

16:44 @danh (hosting)

* @tannewt for mipidsi support in 10.1.0-beta.1  
* @Neradoc for a long-delayed-to-merge PR to the ESP32SPI library to improve its socket API.  
* @FoamyGuy for continued fixes and improvements to Fruit Jam software.

17:34 @CGrover (text only)

* @danh and the team for *asyncio* and the excellent usage examples. Saved my bacon on the latest project.  
* Erin St Blaine (firepixie) and @JohnPark for helpful and comprehensive WLED tutorials, setting the stage for the next project.  
* Congratulations to LadyAda and Phil for the most recent addition\!

18:05 @foamyguy

* @RetiredWizard for submitting FJ OS screensavers, and more improvements to other FJ projects.  
* @danh for working on native ESP32SPI and refactoring the python version to have less complex naming structure  
* @jerryn for reporting an issue with the PixelFed photo viewer project and a fix  
* @justmobilize for reviewing my PR in requests library  
* @somnice for linking me to details on dithering algorithms

19:14 @jerryn

* Congratulations and best wishes to Lady Ada and PT\!  
* Group Hug

19:23 @tannewt (out)

* Congrats to ladyada and pt for their second Adababy.  
* RetiredWizard for the DSI testing

## 20:00 Status Updates

20:15 @danh (hosting)

* Released CircuitPython 10.1.0-beta.1 about 10 days ago. It includes Scott’s mipidsi support and SD card USB presentation fixes.  
* Merged an older PR that improves the socket API in the adafruit\_esp32spi library.  
* Simplified importing the adafruit\_esp32spi library. Both the old and new importing naming schemes are available, food backward compatibility.  
* Working on making `adafruit_esp32spi` be a native module. Successfully doing network scans and other operations now. Need to implement the socket operations.

23:32 @CGrover (text only)

* Completed a sci-fi movie prop lighting controller with 122 NeoPixels and three *asyncio* animation functions. Playground note is here: [https://adafruit-playground.com/u/CGrover/pages/building-a-sci-fi-movie-prop](https://adafruit-playground.com/u/CGrover/pages/building-a-sci-fi-movie-prop)  
  The latest project opened the door for designing and modifying other props for the movie, as well.  
* The next project in the queue is to employ WLED or CircuitPython to create a sound-activated display to be built into a large Hohner Marine Band harmonica store display model for a wall in the studio.  
* My classic rock band just completed its 2025 Second Reunion Tour, opening up the calendar to resume work on my next solo album. Might take a year or more to complete; too many songs to choose from right now *and* I’m contemplating switching to a new DAW (of course).

24:40 @foamyguy

* Added support for screen savers to Fruit Jam OS and implemented a few classic After Dark ones. Wrote a guide page detailing the included ones and how to create custom ones.  
* MagTag 50 Cent CPI tracker project & guide.  
* Trying to implement multi-color dither that can work with the 4 colors available on the MagTag EInk  
* Found a hard crash with np.array and submitted an issue for it.

27:30 @tannewt (out)

* Fixed issue with artifacts on mipidsi display. Issue was incorrect flushing of caches.  
* Working to bring up more DSI displays and create libraries for them.  
* Also updating to Zephyr 4.3.0 in prep for working mostly on Zephyr.

## In The Weeds

## 28:22 Wrap-Up

The next meeting will be in two weeks, on Monday, December 1, at the regular time.
