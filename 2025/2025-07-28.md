### 3:50 CircuitPython 10.0.0-beta.0 Released

CircuitPython 10.0.0-beta.0 is the first beta release for CircuitPython 10\. It has known bugs that will be fixed before the final release. This release also marks the introduction of the new artwork for CircuitPython 10 – [Adafruit Blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2025/07/15/circuitpython-10-0-0-beta-0-released/) and release notes – [GitHub](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/releases/tag/10.0.0-beta.0).

### 5:00 CircuitPython Day 2025 is August 15th

In mid-August each year, Adafruit holds CircuitPython Day. During the day there are broadcasts, there’s likely a discount code, and staff highlight community work on CircuitPython projects. This year it’s Friday, August 15th. Please mark your calendars and keep an eye on the [Adafruit Blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2025/07/28/circuitpython-day-is-august-15-2025/) for additional information. And let us know how you might be celebrating CircuitPython Day by tagging social media with \#CircuitPythonDay2025.

### 6:12 Using DVI Video in CircuitPython

With the release of the Raspberry Pi RP2350, the ability to use the microcontroller to display DVI video on HDMI monitors has grown. Your editor has written a guide to this video capability and how to use it in scenarios from emulated games to full on graphics. If you are looking to use the HSTX bus on the RP2350 to output video, check out this guide on how all the parts work – [Adafruit Learning System](https://learn.adafruit.com/using-dvi-video-in-circuitpython/adafruit_color_terminal).

### 6:55 The CircuitPython Online IDE 2.1 Released

River Wang has released the independently developed CircuitPython Online IDE (integrated development environment) version 2.1 which runs in a modern web browser – [circuitpy.dev](https://urfdvw.github.io/circuitpython-online-ide-2/). Via [X](https://adafruitdaily.us10.list-manage.com/track/click?u=86903b65c84293425f40fa9a5&id=f06029f1d6&e=ae231853d2).  
Highlights of this Release

* Serial Console rewritten with Xterm  
* Progressive Web App  
* Performance improvement and bug fixes

## 16:50 Hug reports

17:13 @dan (hosting)

* @hathach for debugging NINA-FW (for AirLift co-processors) and @FoamyGuy for thorough testing.  
* @tannewt for triage meeting

18:28 @foamyguy

* @dunkmann00 for adding micropython module stubs to circuitpython stubs  
* Liz for figuring out a fix on an issue that came up with using HSTX\_DVI with pico 2 / 2w  
* @Tyeth for reminding me about no\_reset flag needed for esptool test I was trying

19:34 @EGJ Moorington *(missing meeting)*

* @James Fowler, @Dan, @Neradoc, @Foamyguy, @Deshipu and @Elpekenin for helping me with my project\!

19:52 @Liz

* @foamyguy for splitting the workload for new product guides  
* Group hug

20:03 @tannewt (out)

* Liz for driving CP Day planning. (August 15th) Ask us questions here: [https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSczgdHd2AXZJWKZ9S5xX4FzI4FmGRIeWiCSQ7HobYpTEhsYgQ/viewform?usp=header](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSczgdHd2AXZJWKZ9S5xX4FzI4FmGRIeWiCSQ7HobYpTEhsYgQ/viewform?usp=header) 

## 20:40 Status Updates

21:11 @dan (hosting)

* Released 10.0.0-beta.0. This finishes converting to the larger partition scheme on 4MB Espressif boards.  
* Helped test and debug latest NINA-FW with @FoamyGuy and @hathach.  
* All ssl-capable boards now use the full Mozilla root certificate list. For boards with AirLift coprocessors, the same is now true for NINA-FW 3.1.0.  
* Fixed several issues and working on more. Scott and I triaged the 10.0.0 issue list from about 25 down to about 8 issues and pushed non-critical issues forward to 10.x.x.

24:01 @foamyguy

* HSTX DVI CowBell guide  
* Testing nina-fw fixes  
* Trying out old magtag hardware with latest CP build  
* Updating learn guide code to remove usage of deprecated portalbase stuff  
* Some other fixes in portalbase library, and adding functionality to Fruit Jam library to support the same projects as pyportal with minimal changes.  
* Starting to dig in a bit to try to understand PIO peripheral more. Successfully setup output to 8 LEDs, and a 14x2 segment module.

26:57 @Liz

* I added the quad color eInk display to the CircuitPython EPD library. This library is used with Blinka on the Raspberry Pi.  
* I’m working on planning CircuitPython Day 2025\. It is on Friday, August 15th. There will be a few sessions, both live and pre-recorded. One of them is a discussion/q\&a with Scott and Dan. There is a google form where you can [submit questions for the q\&a portion](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSczgdHd2AXZJWKZ9S5xX4FzI4FmGRIeWiCSQ7HobYpTEhsYgQ/viewform?usp=header)  
* For projects, I’m working on a magnetic rotary encoder with the AS5600 breakout. I was able to design and 3D print a print in place bearing for the build that I’m pretty excited about.

28:24 @tannewt (out)

* Working part time.  
* Focusing on supporting new epaper displays. Adding quad color support to CP. Most other stuff is library only.  
* Will do 10.x fixes too.

## 28:47 In The Weeds

@EGJ Moorington *(missing meeting)*

* I’ve recently started working on a project I’d like to eventually make public, so in order to have a clean repo, I used [Adafruit’s circuitpython-cookiecutter template](https://github.com/adafruit/cookiecutter-adafruit-circuitpython) meant for library repositories.  
* I was wondering what approaches other folks have to maintain repositories for their projects. A different cookiecutter template? Some custom workflows (I’m using the ones generated by the template)?  
* @James Fowler gave me some tips on how to structure my code [on a very interesting thread on Discord](https://discord.com/channels/327254708534116352/1398228796317896795). Maybe some of the ideas could be used to make some reusable repos or cookiecutter templates?  
* I’ve read [a Learning Guide that talks about a Project Bundler](https://learn.adafruit.com/contribute-to-the-adafruit-learning-system-with-git-and-github/project-bundler) used to generate Project Bundles for the Learning System’s guides. Since that code isn’t public, maybe a workflow that works in a similar way could be developed.

Response from @foamyguy: There was a tool created by a community member as an attempt to solve this problem: [https://github.com/dhalbert/cookiecutter-playground-bundle](https://github.com/dhalbert/cookiecutter-playground-bundle) It was a created a while back, and we are unsure on it’s current state. Might need maintenance in order to get working. Give it a try and let us know on discord how it goes.

## 33:10 Wrap-Up

Next meeting is in **two** weeks: Monday, August 11, 2025, at the regular time of 2pm US ET / 11am US PT.
