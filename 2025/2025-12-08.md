### 3:10 Why Developers Still Flock to Python: Guido van Rossum on Readability, AI, and the Future of Programming

GitHub sat down with Python creator Guido van Rossum to discuss several modern developments in the industry \- [GitHub Blog](https://github.blog/developer-skills/programming-languages-and-frameworks/why-developers-still-flock-to-python-guido-van-rossum-on-readability-ai-and-the-future-of-programming/).

"The people now writing things for AI are familiar with Python because they started out in machine learning. Python isn’t just the language of AI. It enabled AI to become what it is today. That’s due, in part, to the language’s ability to evolve without sacrificing approachability. AI should adapt to us, not the other way around."

"Python is approachable because it’s designed for developers who are learning, tinkering, and exploring. Python’s future remains bright because its values align with how developers actually learn and build: readability, approachability, stability, and a touch of irreverence."

### 4:10 Why is Everyone Switching (from Arduino) to MicroPython?

Kevin McAleer streams that MicroPython is becoming the language for learning and developing code on microcontrollers. He asks why is this, and what are the main differences from Arduino \- [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/live/6cjYMklEsbk).

### 4:30 Python 3.14.1 is Out With Many Improvements

Python 3.14 was released back in October, but a few bugs managed to push through the big release, and a few other changes weren't ready for prime time. A new minor update has now arrived as Python 3.14.1, containing around 558 bugfixes, build improvements and documentation changes since 3.14.0 \- [How-To Geek](https://www.howtogeek.com/python-3-14-1-arrives-with-a-pile-of-improvements/) and [python.org](https://blog.python.org/2025/12/python-3141-is-now-available.html).

Also released was Python 3.13.10 containing around 300 bugfixes, build improvements and documentation changes since 3.13.9 \- [python.org](https://blog.python.org/2025/12/python-31310-is-now-available-too-you.html).

### 5:18 Newsletter Details

The Python on Microcontrollers Weekly Newsletter is a CircuitPython-community-run newsletter emailed every Monday. The complete archives are [here](https://www.adafruitdaily.com/category/circuitpython/).  It highlights the latest Python on hardware related news from around the web including CircuitPython, Python and MicroPython developments.

## 12:52 Hug reports

13:33 @tannewt (host)

* @samblenny for working on expanding `hashlib`  
* @Renze from Discord again for the ESP32-P4 USB tip. I got it working on the Tab5\!

13:54 @danh

* @samblenny for SHA256 in hashlib PR  
* @FoamyGuy for bitmaptools and BitmapLabel additions  
* @bablokb for doing some timing comparisons between 9.x.x and 10.x.x with USB SD card support and finding a slowdown.

14:47 @foamyguy

* @danh and @makermelissa for reviewing my PR for bitmap label additions and refactoring  
* @JanLunge on Github (maintainer of [Pog](https://github.com/JanLunge/pog)) for responsiveness on issue/PR and making some changes and a quick new release to support CP 10\.  
* @dunkmann00 for submitting many improvements to circup over the last few weeks

15:32 @Liz (notes only)

* @FoamyGuy for getting Pog/KMK working with CP10. That made Noe’s upcoming keyboard guide possible

## 15:45 Status Updates

@tannewt (host)

* Out 12/19 and 12/24-1/1.  
* PR out for getting full USB going on Tab5. (It dynamically switch the USB phys)  
* PR out for adding I2C support to Zephyr port. Dan had some suggestions so I’ll get back to him this morning.  
* Working on getting Tab5 display working. Adding debug prints on Friday made it work so I know it is a delay issue.  
* Caught up on pid.codes reviews.  
* Next up is Zephyr SPI support and then enabling the parts of displayio that build on it.  
* I want to tackle Zephyr BLE in January.  
* Started prep for \#CircuitPython2026 discussion in January. I’m excited to think about what we can do next year\!

18:37 @danh

* Airlift wifi implementation is progressing well. Scanning and fetching various values is working.  
* We’re considering some settings.toml options to turn off BLE workflow, adjust safemode delay, and similar changes.

20:56 @foamyguy

* Display Text refactoring to make BitmapLabel support outlines, accents, and marquee scrolling directly instead of each requiring separate subclasses.  
* MagTag literary quotes clock project code and breaking original quotes file down into 24 parts \+ gzipping them to get it to fit in available flash and RAM.  
* Tested Pog config tool for KMK on a Macropad and submitted some fixes to get it working under CP 10  
* Fruit Jam snowflake maker. Use the mouse, click points to draw “cutout” shapes and it uses vertical and horizontal mirroring to “unfold” the full snowflake. Will adapt it into a holiday card maker that outputs an image to print

## 24:27 In The Weeds

* @tannewt: No meeting on the 29th? So 12/22 and then 1/5. DONE\! Scott will update calendars.

## 25:24 Wrap-Up
