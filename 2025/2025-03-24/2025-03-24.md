## 14:40 Hug reports

@danh	(hosting)

* @jepler’s last week before vacation and semi-retirement. Huge thanks to Jeff for years of smart and very productive work on CircuitPython\!\!  
* @eightycc for fixing multiple issues over the past week.  
* @gamblor21 for a quick PR review.

15:55 @anecdata (text only)

* @eightycc for the mDNS fix, and in general for ongoing work on networking issues

16:07 @eightycc

* @danh and @tannewt for all their help over the last week.  
* @anecdata for writing amazingly useful issues with repro code that make debugging quick and easy.  
* @jepler for helping me get started with Espressif JTAG. Plus, a huge hug for all the work you’ve done on CircuitPython, it’s rare I see a source file you have not touched\!

16:49 @foamyguy

* Adafruit art wizard Bruce for working with me on the Fruit Jam animation and rendering assets that made my life much easier.  
* @Neradoc for submitting improvements to circup allowing it to find libraries recursively instead of just code.py only  
* @Justin for continued work to rid the learn guide repo of secrets.py references.  
* Jeff for all of the great things you’ve contributed to CircuitPython and surrounding projects. And for meeting up to hang out in person on a few occasions. I look forward to doing so again in the future once you are back in town and have had a chance to settle in from the trip.

17:45 @jepler

* Hug for Mark (Gamblor) who posted up some ongoing audio work on Mastodon.  
* Hugs for foamyguy & eightycc – with you here and contributing to the core, you’re making me feel better about stepping away.  
* Group hug  
* I’m proud of the 5ish years I’ve spent working for Adafruit, mostly on CircuitPython.  
* And I’m honored to be a part of this community. The attitude of folks here is amazing and a total antidote to my prior professional life

18:56 @jerryn

* @jepler – Thank you for all you have done (and will do) for the community – Best wishes on your new endeavors\!

19:19 @mark\[gamblor21\] (text only/missing)

* @cooper for continuing to let me bounce ideas off him on audio changes.  
* @jepler \- huge thanks for all your work and help on a huge variety of CircuitPython topics and always having kind words for everyone.

19:41 @todbot (offline, text-only)

* Huge hug to @jepler for all his work on CircuitPython\!

## 19:50 Status Updates

@danh (hosting)

* Released CircuitPython 9.2.5. A user then reported a regression that prevented remounting CIRCUITPY as r/w to Python. I fixed that and released 9.2.6 this weekend. There are a couple of more regressions that should be addressed for a 9.2.7.  
* Fixed seven documentation issues.  
* Corrected Fruit Jam pins and buttons.  
* Issue triage.

22:02 @eightycc

* Fixed several bugs from the issue triage.  
* Learning my way around Espressif builds and debugging.

22:30 @foamyguy

* Working on Fruit Jam animation.  
  * Walked through the code on deep dive and published to a placeholder repo for now: [https://github.com/FoamyGuy/Adafruit\_CircuitPython\_FruitJam\_Animation](https://github.com/FoamyGuy/Adafruit_CircuitPython_FruitJam_Animation)  
  * Submitted a pair of issues relating to audio playback during the animation, and reduced display performance under certain conditions  
* Updated the CircuitPython port of the Matrix code to use more colors and to add the letters in “adafruit” and “jam” to the spritesheet used for the falling glyphs. Cleaned up and added comments to the code and submitted it to the learn repo  
* Made a launcher menu with mouse control to other launch apps/games on the Fruit Jam and take back over when they exit  
* Figured out how to use a combo keyboard / mouse device with USB Host and wrote a submitted a PR to usb\_host\_descriptor library with a helper function for finding a valid mouse endpoint on a device.   
* Cleaned up code/docstrings and submitted PR with ColorConverter support for the TilePaletteMapper module.

25:30 @jepler

* All my work has been in Arduino / pico-sdk land  
* Leaving Tuesday April 1 for an extended trip in Europe.  
* Follow me on the fediverse: [https://social.afront.org/@stylus](https://social.afront.org/@stylus) (personal) [https://metapixl.com/ijtravel](https://metapixl.com/ijtravel) (travel photos w/ my wife)  
* “There are so many things I haven’t done” – I’ll be back to work more with Adafruit & CircuitPython, but the details are TBD. Not before August.
