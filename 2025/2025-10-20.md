### 3:38 CircuitPython 10.0.3 Released

CircuitPython 10.0.3, the latest bugfix revision of CircuitPython, and is a new stable release \- [Adafruit Blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2025/10/17/circuitpython-10-0-3-released/) and release notes \- [GitHub](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/releases/tag/10.0.3).

**Highlights of this Release**

* Fix SPI DMA on `atmel-samd` boards, which fixes SD card mounting problems.  
* Restore SD card USB presentation on `atmel-samd` boards.  
* No changes in this release for non-`atmel-samd` boards.

### 4:38 Project of the Week: Electronic Pumpkin

An updated electric pumpkin from the young folk at GurgleApps\! The latest uses an LED matrix for a flickering flame effect and GC9A01 round LCD displays for the eyes. All programmed in CircuitPython and well documented open source projects. Flickering Flame \- [GitHub](https://github.com/gurgleapps/FlickeringFlame) and [Etsy](https://www.etsy.com/listing/4386406336/rgb-led-matrix-halloween-pumpkin-flame), and Eyes \- [GitHub](https://github.com/gurgleapps/PumpkinEyes-GC9A01). Documented also on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFfcsSoiJz8). Via [X](https://x.com/GurgleApps/status/1978762570619146516).

### 5:15 Evaluating the Arduino Acquisition

The community is now evaluating the Qualcomm acquisition of Arduino last week. This includes implications on open source, processor use going forward, software development tools and more. Will Arduino’s previous embrace of MicroPython still hold, or will Python on Linux take a predominant role?

### EYE on NPI – Qualcomm & Arduino UNO Q Microcontroller Board

Adafruit’s Ladyada takes a detailed look at the new Arduino Uno Q \- [Adafruit Blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2025/10/17/eye-on-npi-qualcomm-arduino-uno-q-microcontroller-board-digikey-arduino-adafruit/).

### Qualcomm Solders Arduino to its Edge AI Ambitions, Debuts Raspberry Pi Rival

Qualcomm acquiring Arduino, maker of microcontrollers (and now single-board computers), is a move designed to boost its presence in edge computing, as evidenced by a new Arduino product based on one of its Dragonwing chips \- [The Register](https://www.theregister.com/2025/10/07/qualcomm_arduino_acquisition/).

“This indicates that Qualcomm sees its acquisition of Arduino as a way to push its AI models and hardware into lots of edge devices, which are predicted to be a key area for AI deployment.”

### Exploring the Arduino App Lab Binary

To understand what the new Arduino UNO Q is about, Sam Blenny has been looking at the new the Arduino App Lab coding tool. The App Lab download page links to the [source code](https://downloads.arduino.cc/app-lab-release/source-app-lab.zip), but the source seems incomplete. Among other differences, there aren’t any build instructions or scripts in the source archive \- [Adafruit Playground](https://adafruit-playground.com/u/SamBlenny/pages/exploring-the-arduino-app-lab-binary).

### 7:26 Newsletter Details

The Python on Microcontrollers Weekly Newsletter is a CircuitPython-community-run newsletter emailed every Monday.

## 17:25 Hug reports

@danh (hosting)

* @tannewt for quickly diagnosing what broke the CircuitPython 10.0.2 build.  
* @phesterman and @jmangum for posting issues re SD card / SPI problems in 10.0.x  
* @tannewt for ESP-IDF v5.5.1 merge.

19:09 @dglaude (lurking)

* Group hug

19:17 @foamyguy

* RetiredWizard for improvements to Spell Jam that allow alternative and local TTS servers, and another for fixes to Logic Gates simulator  
* Group hug

20:20 @tannewt (out)

* Dan for releasing 10.0.0 and 10.0.3.  
* Everyone for all of the pre-release testing of 10.0.0. No major issues were found after it was made stable.

## 20:42 Status Updates

21:10 @danh (hosting)

* I fixed SD card problems on atmel-samd ports and then released CircuitPython 10.0.3 with those fixes. 10.0.2 had build problems and was skipped.  
* There are SD card issues on other ports causing crashes which I am looking at.

21:55 @dglaude (lurking)

* I broke a finger Sunday and I noticed my thumb writing skill is not as affected as my 10 fingers typing.  
  * I searched for a solution to type from my phone on my company (locked) laptop, I imagined to talk Bluetooth to an NRF board that does USB-HID.  
  * Gemini (Pro 2.5) wrote some perfect CP code to build a UART over BLE to USB-HID bridge, the suggestion being to use the app “Bluefruit Connect” to send strings from the phone.  
  * Then I asked for Belgian French keyboard, and Gemini pointed to Neradoc library (hallucinating the presence of the file I needed) \=\> using Neradoc web site, I created the Belgian keyboard python file.  
  * Full code \=\> [https://gist.github.com/dglaude/44956c676aed5651beadc84ab82bedad](https://gist.github.com/dglaude/44956c676aed5651beadc84ab82bedad)  
  * In retrospect, an app that turns your phone into a BLE Keyboard is more simple… but does not involve CP, and might lack Belgian French keyboard.

23:18 @foamyguy

* Logic Gates Simulator learn guide published  
* Working on SPA06-003 SPI support  
* Apple //e emulator guide  
* Adabot patch for all libraries, remove deprecated ruff config & fix RTD style issue

24:53 @tannewt (out)

* PR out for IDF 5.5.1 merge.  
* Started (using claude) to stub out `mipidsi` module for DSI support.  
* Got M5Stack Tab5 which is a P4 and DSI display.  
* Back full time starting in December when youngest goes to daycare.
