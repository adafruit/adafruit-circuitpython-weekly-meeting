# CircuitPython Weekly Meeting for June 16, 2025

*Welcome to the CircuitPython Weekly meeting notes\! Feel free to add your Hug Reports and Status Updates before the meeting, alphabetically by your username. During the meeting, we go through them in order. If you can’t make the meeting and would still like to participate, add your notes with a “(missing meeting)” after your username and we’ll read them off for you.* 

*Add any longer-form discussion topics or general questions you have to the “In the weeds” section.* 

*We now convert this document to Markdown on export, instead of including explicit raw Markdown formatting. When you type, just format your contributions with regular Google Docs formatting.

## 13:29 Hug reports

13:51 @foamyguy (hosting)

* Dan for putting newsletter links in chat  
* Group Hug

14:06 @danh

* @eightycc for reviewing the MicroPython v1.24.1 merge.

## 14:35 Status Updates

15:03 @foamyguy (hosting)

* Startup screens guide  
* Wrote example for plotting AIO data on a graph with displayio. On PyPortal now, but destined for Fruit Jam  
  * Updating the Sparkline class to allow adding a list of multiple values with one function call.  
* Fixed several esp32spi examples in adafruit\_io repo that were using old API to access ap\_info.  
* Updated Metro 2350 SDcard examples to work under both 9.x and 10.x with new automounting behavior  
* Finishing up a guide page for the ESP32-S2 detailing deep sleep and posting sensor data to AIO.

17:06 @danh

* Finished MicroPython v1.24.1 merge. @eightycc reviewed and merged. Will start on MicroPython v1.25 merge.  
* Redid partition scheme to merge two firmware partitions (one for OTA) into one for 4MB **non**\-UF2 Espressif boards to increase firmware size. CIRCUITPY does not move and is not affected. There are two different partition schemes which are preserved. This is forward and backward compatible.  
* Will release CircuitPython 10.0.0-alpha.7, probably today.
