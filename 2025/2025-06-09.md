### A Coordinated Python Security Update Release

To fix six vulnerability reports, the Python Software Foundation simultaneously released five new versions of Python. Python 3.13.4, 3.12.11, 3.11.13, 3.10.18 and 3.9.23 are now available. In addition to the security fixes, a few additional changes to ipaddress were backported to make the edits feasible – [Python Discussion Forum](https://discuss.python.org/t/python-3-13-4-3-12-11-3-11-13-3-10-18-and-3-9-23-are-now-available/94367).

### 3:22 What is Vibe Coding? A Computer Scientist Explains What It Means to Have AI Write Computer Code − and What Risks That Can Entail

Vibe coding leans on standard patterns of technical language, which AI systems use to piece together original code from their training data. Any beginner can use an AI assistant such as GitHub Copilot or Cursor Chat, put in a few prompts, and let the system get to work – [The Conversation](https://theconversation.com/what-is-vibe-coding-a-computer-scientist-explains-what-it-means-to-have-ai-write-computer-code-and-what-risks-that-can-entail-257172) and [YouTube](https://youtu.be/P7lryCIvxgA).

“AI tools do this without any real grasp of specific rules, edge cases or security requirements for the software in question. This is a far cry from the processes behind developing production-grade software, which must balance trade-offs between product requirements, speed, scalability, sustainability and security. Skilled engineers write and review the code, run tests and establish safety barriers before going live.”

### 4:42 The Wrong Way to Use AI (and How to Actually Write Better Code with LLMs)

**![The Wrong Way to Use AI](https://shawnhymel.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/claude-4-refactor-thumbnail.png)**

Claude 4’s beautifully broken refactor is a perfect metaphor for engineering in 2025\. Tools are improving rapidly. But they’re only as useful as the engineer wielding them. When AI outputs a beautifully structured but non-compiling refactor, it’s not a failure, it’s a mirror, revealing where human judgment still matters most. For developers serious about continuously learning, that mirror is invaluable – [Shawn Hymel](https://shawnhymel.com/2759/the-wrong-way-to-use-ai-and-how-to-actually-write-better-code-with-llms/).

## 14:34 Hug reports

14:54 @danh (hosting)

* @bablokb for fixing a build issue  
* @Timeline8 for fixing a board issue

15:10 @david.glaude (absent)

* @danh and @anecdata for help and suggestions for my [network.py](http://network.py) include file (in the weeds of last week).  
* @foamyguy for FruitJam work and video.

15:36 @foamyguy

* @shubham0x13 on github for submitting a convenience feature for anchoring Labels and being open to feedback about moving it elsewhere and making it more generic to work with other objects

## 16:00 Status Updates

16:36 @danh (hosting)

* Merging MicroPython v1.24.1 into CircuitPython. I’ve finished the initial file merging and will start testing compilations and running tests. After this I’ll merge v1.25.  
* Will test C6 version of NINA-FW for use on the Fruit Jam board, for WiFi and BLE.

17:46 @foamyguy

* Startup Screens learn guide that talks about them generally and details the experience working on the Fruit Jam startup  
* Working on Fruit Jam library adding peripherals implementations for built-in hardware  
* Factorio integration with CircuitPython. Achieved successful communication both ways. Want to refactor some more and get it into a shareable state and document how it works. Perhaps it can serve as a gateway to microcontrollers and circuitpython for the factorio community.

## 19:52 In The Weeds

We only have three hosts available for the weekly meeting for now. We have a weekly schedule through the end of June. How would every other week be if we did that for part of the summer?

## 22:46 Wrap-Up

Monday June 16, 2025 will be our next meeting, at the regular time.
