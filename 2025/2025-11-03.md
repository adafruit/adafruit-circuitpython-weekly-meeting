# CircuitPython (Bi-)Weekly Meeting for November 3, 2025

*Welcome to the CircuitPython Weekly meeting notes\! Feel free to add your Hug Reports and Status Updates before the meeting, alphabetically by your username. During the meeting, we go through them in order. If you can’t make the meeting and would still like to participate, add your notes with a “(missing meeting)” after your username and we’ll read them off for you.* 

*Add any longer-form discussion topics or general questions you have to the “In the weeds” section.* 

*We now convert this document to Markdown on export, instead of including explicit raw Markdown formatting. When you type, just format your contributions with regular Google Docs formatting. If you type using Markdown formatting characters, your input will be converted on the fly to formatted text. You can also right-click and “Paste as Markdown” any text that is using raw Markdown.*

*Thanks\! We hope to see you in the meeting\!*

### 03:51 The 2025 Hackaday Superconference Communicator Badge runs MicroPython

The badge for the Hackaday Superconference this past weekend is a rather powerful device sporting an ESP32-S3 with 8 MB of PSRAM and 16 MB of flash, LCD screen, SX1262 LoRa module, LiPo battery/charging and a Solder Party custom keyboard. It runs MicroPython with `lvgl_micropython` running on the display for LVGL graphics \- [Hackaday](https://hackaday.com/2025/10/23/announcing-the-2025-hackaday-superconference-communicator-badge/) and [GitHub](https://github.com/Hack-a-Day/2025-Communicator_Badge).

* @tannewt (Scott) for discussions on SD card bug and on wifi co-processor work.

20:54 @tannewt (out)

* Folks on the [Embedded.fm](http://Embedded.fm) slack for pointers on where to get DSI displays.

## 21:10 Status Updates

21:40 @foamyguy (hosting)

* Updated 286 emulator and FJ Logic Gates guides with improvements from Anne and RetiredWizard  
* Code and guide for using edge models on the Pi 5 for translation and multi-lingual TTS. Update text to be general and support both Speaker Bonnet and Voice Bonnet.  
* Finished converting CPy requests library tests to use a local webserver script and Adafruit quotes API instead of 3rd party servers for all tests & submit PR.  
* Code for Pixelfed social image viewer for Fruit Jam

23:40 @danh

* Fixed a set of bugs that caused USB disconnects when mounting an SD card in user code and having it presented via USB.  
* Now working on turning ESP32SPI into a native module. Considering what kind of API we want to present for WiFi coprocessors.

27:15 @tannewt

* Going to PR `mipidsi` module for DSI display support on the ESP32-P4. It will be experimental until we get a bunch of boards working with it.  
* Out 11/5-11/11. Back full time in December.
