# CircuitPython Weekly Meeting for May 19, 2025

*Welcome to the CircuitPython Weekly meeting notes\! Feel free to add your Hug Reports and Status Updates before the meeting, alphabetically by your username. During the meeting, we go through them in order. If you can’t make the meeting and would still like to participate, add your notes with a “(missing meeting)” after your username and we’ll read them off for you.*

## 11:37 Hug reports

Eightycc (hosting)

* Neradoc for help and advice on \#9171 web workflow freezes  
* Dan for all the help and support over the last week  
* Group hug\! Have I mentioned that I love the CircuitPython project and the team? I do.

@danh

* @eightycc for fixing a regression in 10.0.0-alpha.5 on Saturday so I was able to do a quick fix release.

David Glaude (not present):

* FoamyGuy for taking over the Deep Dive, I actually like the one hour format, and the last one on Sparkle was really helpful for me to know how to handle ESP32 CircuitPython like my Lillygo 2020 v3 smart watch.  
* Neradoc for sharing his watch face (CP Code) for the Lillygo 2020 v3 smart watch.

Foamyguy

* @justmobilize and @anecdata for looking into and discussion around an issue with adafruit\_requests and 204 response status  
* @jepler for popping in and answering a question I posted in discord.  
* @joepardue on Github for submitting a library to the community bundle and working through the release and bundling issues

## 14:20 Status Updates

Eightycc (hosting)

* Working on 10.0.0 issues. The list keeps getting smaller.  
* Working on an interesting ESP32-S2 issue that is causing web workflow to sputter and freeze.


@danh

* Released CircuitPython 10.0.0-alpha.5 on Thursday to include a bunch of new changes. Regression on various ARM boards found: @eightycc fixed it on Saturday and I released alpha.6 Saturday night with that fix.  
* alpha.5 and later include the new partition scheme for 4MB Feather ESP32-S3. Wrote up Guide page how to upgrade the TinyUF2 bootloader to allow using that build: [https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-esp32-s3-feather/update-tinyuf2-bootloader-for-circuitpython-10-4mb-boards-only](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-esp32-s3-feather/update-tinyuf2-bootloader-for-circuitpython-10-4mb-boards-only) . Anyone who has a chance, try it out, and see if the instructions are clear.  
* eightycc and I triaged the remaining 10.0.0 bugs this morning. There are less than 20 left.

David Glaude (not present):

* Zero progress on documenting my EVCC monitoring on PyPortal (reading status from MQTT and presenting on screen) “As seen on “Show and Tell”.  
* Finally succeeded to use my “Lillygo 2020 v3 Smart Watch” with CircuitPython… maybe I could reuse my EVCC/MQTT code to have a watch that display my solar panel electric production and the charging of my car.  
* Soldering my Franken Fruit Jam (but I am missing Product ID: 4449 “**USB Type A Jack Breakout Cable** with Premium Female Jumpers”)  
* Testing with Anne Matrix demo (found out that maybe reporting error/problem with learn guide is broken)

Foamyguy

* Converting all libraries to use ruff instead of pylint and black. Used claude code to help with some of the tedious parts of the process and learned a lot about to get it up and running inside of a container and refining workflow and prompts to distill the parts it’s good at down to very concise instructions that it’s able to complete quickly.  
  * Found a few repos with unrelated problems during the process and created issues for them that I will go back and fix this week  
* Working on Sparkle Motion Stick CircuitPython guide pages
