# CircuitPython Weekly Meeting for May 27, 2025

*Welcome to the CircuitPython Weekly meeting notes\! Feel free to add your Hug Reports and Status Updates before the meeting, alphabetically by your username. During the meeting, we go through them in order. If you can’t make the meeting and would still like to participate, add your notes with a “(missing meeting)” after your username and we’ll read them off for you.* 

*Add any longer-form discussion topics or general questions you have to the “In the weeds” section.* 

*We now convert this document to Markdown on export, instead of including explicit raw Markdown formatting. When you type, just format your contributions with regular Google Docs formatting. If you type using Markdown formatting characters, your input will be converted on the fly to formatted text. You can also right-click and “Paste as Markdown” any text that is using raw Markdown.*

*Thanks\! We hope to see you in the meeting\!*

***Tim** is hosting.*

## 18:39 Hug reports

19:09 @foamyguy (hosting)

* anecdata, Neradoc, and danh all for offering ideas on how to read a short pulse on an IO pin that digitalio was not able to see.  
* @cinderblockgames on github for submitting improvements to adafruit\_display\_text and looking into issues reported in the library.  
* Group hug

19:53 @danh

* @jepler for PR’s even while he’s on vacation  
* @Neradoc for several fixes

20:10 @david.glaude (not present)

* Neradoc for bootstrapping me with T-Watch V3  
* Foamyguy for bootstrapping me with web workflow  
* Anne and Melissa for Metro RP2350 learn guides  
* Gemini 2.5 Flash for helping me make my EVCC visualisation compatible with asyncio  
* Group hug

20:51 @jepler (no mic)

* Group hug. Miss y’all\!

## 21:01 Status Updates

21:36 @foamyguy (hosting)

* Tested examples and wrote learn guide pages for Sparkle Motion Stick with CircuitPython and a few of the Arduino ones  
* Completed the issues that popped up during the ruff conversion but were unrelated to it.  
* Ported the OPT4048 Arduino driver to CircuitPython  
  * Made a new version of the web demo that gets hosted under adafruit\_httpserver on the device, and uses websocket to communicate data from the sensor instead of webserial so it works in all browsers.  
  * Created a primitive system for transmitting bytes of data by flashing colors on an RGB LED and reading them with the OPT4048 sensor. Not practical, but a fun exercise in “I wonder if I can make it do this”  
* Library PR reviews


  

23:37 @danh

* Debugging a sleep problem on nRF52840: after deep sleep, HID doesn’t work, but still appears to be connected.  
* A GitHub user offered USB traces that may be relevant to the problem we’re having with ChromeOS and the SAMD UF2 bootloader. My traces don’t show the same issue, though.  
* Fixed I2CTarget problem.

24:17 @david.glaude (not present)

* Ported my EVCC+MQTT visualisation from PyPortal to T-Watch 2020 V3  
  * Getting “Gemini 2.5 Flash” to make my code co-execute together with existing asyncio code that handle the watch button/irq  
  * Hitting limitation in minimqtt.loop that is blocking and that does not play well with asyncio code  
  * Making sure the same code works on Memento (same resolution, also use Espressif, much easier to use for me than Web Workflow)  
  * Adapting PyPortal 320x240 design to 240x240 screen space  
* Franken’s Fruit Jam on Metro RP2350  
  * Testing Matrix screensaver (and found a breaking API change between 9 and 10.0.6-alpha)  
  * Soldering a USB-A Host connector  
  * Playing MineSweeper to test the mouse  
  * Ranting on USB pin order on Adafruit USB Hub breakout

25:58 @eightycc

* Working on RP2350 sleep modes. I have light sleep and dormant deep sleep working. Power manager low-power mode is proving to be challenging.

27:00 @jepler (no mic)

* Added a new compiler flag to most ports (-Wold-style-definition) and fixed resulting diagnostics.  
* Filed a PR that gets rid of a couple of CIRCUITPY-CHANGEs by using a newer macro used by micropython. Should be no behavioral difference but I have no HW to test it on while traveling.  
* I’ve been working on a version of the unix port that can play audio (synthio etc) on a host computer. This is pushed to my personal github fork. Will not be PR’d anytime soon, probably  
* Past the halfway point of my Europe trip, sleeping in Malmö Sweden tonight.
