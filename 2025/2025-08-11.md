* @liz for organizing circuitpython day


13:07 @todbot (text only)
* @SamBlenny for all the DVI & USB host work on FruitJam
* @Liz for CircuitPython day work!


# 13:19 Status Updates
13:35 @Liz (hosting)
* I’ve been doing a lot of prep for CircuitPython Day. I think the sessions this year are really interesting.
* I wrote a CircuitPython driver for the QMC5883 magnetometer along with a Learn Guide
* I’m going to be on vacation the last two weeks of August so I’m trying to wrap things up this week in preparation for that.


14:11 @david.glaude (text only)
* Acquired cardputer v1.0 and v1.1 to test CP9 and CP10
   * CP9 is OK but on V1.1 the RGB LED is not on until the screen is on => some boot blinking are missing
   * CP10 bootloop with the screen flashing with or without content/garbage
* Analyze the (leak about) cardputer ADV to see if CP will be possible on it
   * Build in keyboard is not a matrix directly connected to GPIO but via I2C and TCA8418
      * Could work, but without firmware support for the keyboard input
      * TCA8418 is supported in CP, so Python reading of the keyboard would work 
* Testing Send/Receive of ESPNOW with two cardputer and one Tembed
   * WIP: Trying to do a ESPNOW chat between two cardputer (reading keyboard from stdin)
      * Receiving ANSI code for backspace and arrow => require parsing for line editing


15:22 @foamyguy
* Finished up guide pages for the Fruit Jam product guide
* Tested out gpt-oss:20b running locally on my desktop, and KittenTTS running on a Pi 5
* Working on a weather forecast narrator that pulls forecast from NWS, narrates it into .wav files with KittenTTS. Then, when you press a button, it reads aloud the current date and forecast.
* Game Jam stream on CircuitPython day


17:42 @tannewt (out)
* Recorded discussion with Dan and Liz for CircuitPython day.
* Primarily doing epaper drivers.
   * 5.83” mono and tricolor and 7.5” are all the same driver.
   * 3.7” mono and tricolor are supported too.
   * 4.2” screens are supported.
   * 2.66” screens are WIP. Not cooperating even though they have an existing driver. 
   * Will PR internal refactor before working on partial refresh support.
* Got two P4 boards. They have v1.0 and v1.3 of the P4. So, I have the latest.
# In The Weeds
* No topics today

# 18:35 Wrap-Up
Next meeting is in two weeks on Monday, August 25th
