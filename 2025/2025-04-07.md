CircuitPython Weekly Meeting for April 7, 2025


Welcome to the CircuitPython Weekly meeting notes! Feel free to add your Hug Reports and Status Updates before the meeting, alphabetically by your username. During the meeting, we go through them in order. If you can’t make the meeting and would still like to participate, add your notes with a “(missing meeting)” after your username and we’ll read them off for you. 


Add any longer-form discussion topics or general questions you have to the “In the weeds” section. 


We now convert this document to Markdown on export, instead of including explicit raw Markdown formatting. When you type, just format your contributions with regular Google Docs formatting.

Thanks! We hope to see you in the meeting!

11:42 @Liz (hosting) 
* group hug!


11:45 @danh
* @relic-se for updating Biquad for 10.0.0 alpha.
* @tannewt for quick fixes on USB host issues for the first released 10.0.0 alpha.
* @wtuemura, who has been doing the Brazilian Portugese translation for years, and has to take a break for now. They have been one of the quickest to update translations as needed. Thanks so much for all these years of work.


13:27 @foamyguy
* @Neradoc for some updates to Bitmapsaver for displayio 10.x API changes
* @danh for making new releases and for working on 10.x bundle building in various places
* Group hug


13:54 @Mark(Gamblor21) [no voice]
* @cooper, @tannewt for testing / reviewing the Chorus effect
* @paul cutler for having me back for a panel discussion on audio effects in the CircuitPython show that’s out today.
* Group hug


14:09 @tannewt
* Foamyguy for all of the CP games and fruit jam work. I’m excited to help join it all together.


14:39 @todbot (text only, not present)
* @Mark(Gamblor21) & @cooper/@relic-se for all the cool synthio / audioeffects work!
* @prcutler for his podcast empire
* @danh for new releases and his RP2350-E9 efforts
14:57 Status Updates
15:18 @Liz (hosting)
* This past week I worked on some CircuitPython code for an asteroid tracker targeting the 2024 YR4 asteroid. I used two free NASA API’s, sentry and close approach, to fetch the date, % of earth impact and how many miles it will be from earth and the moon. To make the display a little more interesting, I added a small asteroid bitmap that flies across the display diagonally
* From wednesday-friday i’ll be out on a quick vacation to visit some family, so i’m looking forward to that


16:06 @danh
* Reported that discord #newproducts feed integration was broken, noticed by a discord user. PT has fixed this.
* Released CircuitPython 10.0.0-alpha.2 last Friday.
* SAMD UF2 not working on Chromebooks. The drive is being recognized, and is assigned a device name, but is not mounted. nRF52, TinyUF2, and RP2xxxx UF2 bootloaders all still work. More work to do on this. Next steps are to file an issue on ChromeOS, and to get some USB traces to see what is going on at the MSC level.
* Fixing various bugs for 10.0.0 and reviewing PR’s.


17:40 @eightycc
* Deep in the weeds on issue #9937. This is a crashing bug affecting ESP32-S3 that manifests while running an idle http host. Going deep with JTAG and a variety of ESP-IDF and OpenRTOS debugging tools I’ve been unable to isolate it. Time-boxing it for now so I can move on to other 10.0.0 milestone issues.
* Plan to work on other 10.0.0 milestone issues this week.


18:29 @foamyguy
* Learned how to read mouse data from 8byte packets and updated example to support either 4 or 8 size.
* Reviewed bitmap saver updates and attempted to make changes in the core to get it working with 8bit color displays. 
* Memory Game guide published
* Refactored SizedGroup into AnchoredGroup and cookie cut repo for it
* Updates for “Match3” my next game guide which is inspired by card game Set
   * New sprites and title screen
   * Support 4 & 8 byte mouse packet
   * Support 720x400 display size
   * Autosave and resume with CPSAVES and SDCard


20:56 @tannewt
* Three and a half weeks until I’m on paternity leave again
* Working on Fruit Jam OS. Repo here: https://github.com/adafruit/Fruit-Jam-OS
   * Added working_directory option for set_next_code_file.
   * Adding basic pathlib for using to discover apps.
   * Ended deep dive with some sort of crash. Gotta load that context back in my brain.

22:27 In The Weeds


22:43 @todbot (text only, not present, meeting collision)
* `touchio` on RP2350: hey @DanH, I’ve come around to your way of thinking in https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues/9541#issuecomment-2341792598
I figure now any touchio is better than no touchio.
I made a branch that implements a simple “pullup touchio” for RP2350 here:
https://github.com/todbot/circuitpython/tree/touchio_pullup_rp2350
Should I submit it as a PR? 
   * Yes please. We can hash out details on the PR.
