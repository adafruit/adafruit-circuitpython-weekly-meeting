## 14:35 Hug reports

@danh (hosting)

* @samblenny for discovering TLV320 setup issues. Proposed a PR with changes that considerably improve sound quality.  
* @bablokb and @jerryneedell for RFM fixes that considerably improve performance.

15:50 @david.glaude (not present)

* Group hug and season greetings.

15:57 @foamyguy

* @SamBlenny for audio improvements.  
* Group hug

16:20 @SamBlenny (text only)

* @danh and @relic-se for input on TLV320DAC improvements

16:30 @tannewt

* Echo Dan’s hug for @SamBlenny. Thanks for digging into the audio weeds. Dan too for helping Sam work through it.  
* Timeline8 for a README improvement to highlight colstart for SSD1680.  
* Happy holidays everyone.

## 17:30 Status Updates

17:55 @danh (hosting)

* Making progress on native C wifi/socketpool/ssl for AirLift. Debugging SPI locking and socket operations right now.

19:07 @david.glaude (not present)

* (WIP) Trying to run CP on CardPuter ADV.  
  * Old CardPuter firmware activates the screen but blocks the pins needed for I2C.  
  * Trying to detach the keyboard matrix crashes the CardPuter. (Issue \#10692 \=\> [https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues/10692](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues/10692))  
  * Option 1: Start from M5 Stamp naked firmware and do everything in Python land. (Some success enabling the screen from Python)  
  * Option 2: Remove keyboard scanning from the old CardPuter firmware to free the I2C pins. (Pull \#10757 \=\> [https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/pull/10757](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/pull/10757)) \=\> Works except keyboard and son.  
  * Next step: Scan the keyboard with Python code using TCA8418 library... but no success so far.  
* (Success) Using a QT-PY RP2040 to convert USB-CDC serial command into analog joystick left-right.  
  * One family member needed to generate analog joystick move based on camera analysis in order to control a game.  
  * Gemini suggested to use a Pico so he came asking for hardware.  
  * I provided to him the hardware with working code prototype (with help from Gemini too).  
  * It is working, but there is still too much input latency (likely on the image analysis) to be fully usable.

20:53 @foamyguy

* Finished FJ greeting card maker guide  
* Published checkbox library  
* Reviewing PRs in FJ OS and Circup and other libs  
* Refactor FJ OS to reuse installed libraries for each language build, speeding up the build time significantly. And added ruff / pre-commit to the repo

22:20 @SamBlenny (text only)

* Working on Fruit Jam TLV320 I2S DAC audio quality improvements for low sample rates. This should hopefully make it easier to do small 8 kHz wav file sound effects for games and such.

22:40 @tannewt

* Switched Zephyr port to Zephyr USB instead of TinyUSB. It makes these boards “just work” so much better. It does both USB MSC and CDC. HID and MIDI should be doable in the future. Zephyr host support is behind TinyUSB at the moment.  
* Added MCXN947 and iMXRT1170 board defs to the Zephyr port.  
* I have untested code for I2S output.  
* Doing a year end pass on pid.codes reviews because some of them were for CP boards. Many keyboards w/QMK too.  
* Ordered a Jumperless V5 to ease testing between MCU and breakouts.  
* Will kick off \#CircuitPython2026 in January.

## 26:05 In The Weeds

@david.glaude:

* Any suggestions for CardPuter ADV?  
  * Close [https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/pull/10757](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/pull/10757) (was just done to have a working UF2 from the pipeline)?  
  * Create a new board CardPuter ADV identical to current CardPuter board but without keyboard and renaming pin (as a starting point)?

## 28:20 Wrap-Up

No meeting next week due to the holidays. Next meeting is Monday, January 5, 2026\.
